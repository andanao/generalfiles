\begin{rSection}{Projects}
{\bf Dynamic Analysis of Buckling Restrained Braces}
\\The project aims at designing and fabrication of two Buckling Restrained Braces which were analyzed under dynamic loading. As alternative for conventional braces, these BRBs are also beneficial for seismic retro-fitting in RCC and steel structures.\\
\\{\bf Indirect Model Analysis of Structures}\\
Presented a Seminar on Indirect Model Analysis, explaining the method to compute response of Prototype from the Influence lines obtained from Model. Use of Muller Breslau Principle in Indirect Model Analysis and the Similitude between prototype and  model.\\

\\{\bf Microtunneling}\\
Presented a seminar on Micro Tunneling, explaining its advantages over conventional method of drainage laying systems. Analysis considering direct and indirect cost of micro tunneling was also discussed.
